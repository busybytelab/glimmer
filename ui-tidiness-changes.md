# UI Tidiness Changes

## Components Created

### 1. LoadingSpinner Component
Created a reusable loading spinner component that:
- Supports different sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Supports different colors
- Reduces duplication across the codebase
- Located at: `ui/src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.svelte`

### 2. ErrorAlert Component
Created a standardized error alert component that:
- Takes a message and optional title
- Provides consistent error styling
- Reduces duplication
- Located at: `ui/src/components/common/ErrorAlert.svelte`

## Pages Updated

1. **Layout Page**
   - Updated with `LoadingSpinner` and `ErrorAlert`

2. **Practice Topics Pages**
   - Updated `[id]/+page.svelte` to use the components

3. **Practice Session Page**
   - Updated with components while preserving print functionality

4. **Login Page**

## Benefits

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate spinner and error alert implementations
- **Improved Consistency**: UI elements now have a consistent look and behavior

- **Easier Extensibility**: The components can be extended with more features when needed

## Future Improvements

1. Create more common components for:
